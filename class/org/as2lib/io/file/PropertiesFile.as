/**
 * {@code PropertiesFile} represents a file of properties.
 *
 * <p>A properties file contains simple key-value pairs. Multiple pairs are
 * separated by line terminators (\n or \r or \r\n). Keys are separated from
 * values with the characters '=', ':' or a white space character.
 *
 * <p>Comments are also supported. Just add a '#' or '!' character at the
 * beginning of your comment-line.
 *
 * <p>If you want to use any of the special characters in your key or value you
 * must escape it with a back-slash character '\'.
 *
 * <p>The key contains all of the characters in a line starting from the first
 * non-white space character up to, but not including, the first unescaped
 * key-value-separator.
 *
 * <p>The value contains all of the characters in a line starting from the first
 * non-white space character after the key-value-separator up to the end of the
 * line. You may of course also escape the line terminator and create a value
 * across multiple lines.
