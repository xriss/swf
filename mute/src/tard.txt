Pointless. 1/5.
Yup, boring
teleporters are annoying. 3/5
K i gotta ask. WTF IS GOING ON? Also, there's glitches galore.
Reflection is unneeded, the game is repetitive, and there is too much gravity
the game suck -5/5 you should put a pause, some upgrades and not always the same thing!!!
I always play with my own background music (so I can concentrate more) so please put a mute button

I can't say anything good about this game
So bad, so boring. This game is really a sh*t. 1/5
definitely 1/5, this dross did not even finish loading
back game, worst one ever. nver playign again! they should tak off kong.
Games without mute, should not be made into challenges. Grrrrr.
pretty good, but since this is a click spamming game, its a little annoying to have ads in the game that pop up an external window.
Yes, it is all the click spamming, buried in the game, in the drawers and such, when I said, Is it just to sell advertising? I guess the answer is YES!
I won your bent little game and all I have to say is 1. You got issues. 2. You have good art and flash skills, just no concept of what a good game is.
It's perfectly fine for you to assume that I don't know what the word copyrighted means. In response to your comment, *paste google* *paste google*.
MAKE IT SO IF YOU IN AIR YOU DONT LOSE FUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! until then 2/5
always the same..maybe do something new? 2,5/%
