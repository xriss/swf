This directory contains a random set of scripts intended to benchmark Lua Alchemy performance.
There are two main sources: 

  lua/ -- Lua 5.1.4 distribution (copied from test/ directory)
  shootout/ -- Computer Language Benchmarks Game (http://shootout.alioth.debian.org)

Note some files are missing. We include only benchmarks without external dependencies and that 
could be run without extra arguments as

  $ lua <benchmark.lua>

Feel free to contribute your pet benchmarks.
